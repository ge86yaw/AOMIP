## Important
* Please execute `python -B tests/test_hw02.py` from repository root directory for all the output except the submission for the challenge.
* Concrete implementations are in `aomip` directory as described in the description. For the context of this assignment, this corresponds to the implementation of `gradient_descent.py`. All iterative methods are looped over using the gradient descent algorithm in `tests/test_hw02.py`. Hence, executing this file yields the results.
* No external packages were used in the implementation other than provided.

## Remarks
* Script points to the `/srv/ceph/share-all/aomip/6983008_seashell/` directory.
* [Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/6983008#.ZFnciexByu4) was used for all methods.
* Script writes all results to the `homework/hw2/output` directory of the corresponding task.

## Homework 1: Preprocessing again
* For this task, every image, i.e., `.tif` file was iteratively sliced by the middle row index and stacked side-by-side to obtain a shallow sinogram. Implementation is available via `homework/hw02/slicing.py`. 

##Â Homework 2: Iterative Reconstruction
* Gradient descent is implemented and parametrized by number of iterations, learning_rate, the data to be to be optimized, and the gradient. Because the calculation of the gradient is cost function depended, it was parametrized for readability and re-usability.

## Homework 3: Solving CT Problems (i)
* The `XrayOperator.py` class was used to generate the system matrix (sparse) `A` and the formulation in the assignment for obtaining the derivative was implemented.
* The original and reconstructed image are plotted side-by-side and [results](https://gitlab.lrz.de/IP/teaching/applied-optimization-methods-for-inverse-problems/aomip-kaan-guney-keklikci/-/tree/main/homework/hw02/output/least_squares) are available via the subfolder corresponding to the task in the output directory.
