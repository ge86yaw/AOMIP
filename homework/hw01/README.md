## Requirements
* Inside the homework file, you will find a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.
* Arguably if not the most, one of the most important dependencies is the [python-dotenv]("https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/") package, which configures the script variables from a sourced `.env` file. To establish this, `.gitignore` was modified accordingly.
* Also, please execute all scripts to create output files from the root directory.
